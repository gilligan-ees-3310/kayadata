### NOTES: 

* **r-hub ubuntu and debian**: False-positive warning about 
  (possibly) invalid URL <https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/archive/ieo17/>.
  This only occurs on r-hub builder and not other builds. I have checked this 
  URL manually and it is correct and working when I visit it from a web 
  browser.
  
    This URL is the underlying source of the data provided by this package
    (it's listed in "\source" lines in td_trends.Rd and td_values.Rd).
    It is a third-party web site operated by the U.S. Department of Energy
    and is not under my control.

* **r-hub debian only**: False-positive warning about (possible) misspellings
  for four people's names in DESCRIPTION: "Kaya", "Keiichi", "Yoichi", and 
  "Yokobori". These names are spelled correctly.

* This submission is an update from version 0.4.1 to 0.4.2.

    I have updated the data to incorporate the 2019 Statistical Report on 
    World Energy.

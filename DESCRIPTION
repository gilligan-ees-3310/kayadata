Description: Provides data for Kaya identity variables (population, gross 
             domestic product, primary energy consumption, and energy-related 
             CO2 emissions) for the world and for individual nations, and 
             utility functions for looking up data,  plotting trends of 
             Kaya variables, and plotting the fuel mix for a given country
             or region. The Kaya identity (Yoichi Kaya and Keiichi Yokobori, 
             "Environment, Energy, and Economy: Strategies for Sustainability" 
             (United Nations University Press, 1998) and 
             <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaya_identity>) expresses a nation's 
             or region's greenhouse gas emissions in terms of its population, 
             per-capita Gross Domestic Product, the energy intensity of its 
             economy, and the carbon-intensity of its energy supply.

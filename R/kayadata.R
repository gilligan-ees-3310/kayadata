#' @description
#'
#' kayadata is a package for working with Kaya identity data for many countries
#' and regions.
#'
#' The data covers 1960-2017 for population and GDP, and 1965-2017 for
#' energy and fossil-fuel CO2 emissions.
#'
#' The package uses data on population and GDP from the World Bank,
#' using market exchange rates (MER) for GDP because those data go back to
#' 1960. From 1990 onward, Purchasing-Power-Parity (PPP) GDP figures are
#' available as \code{G_ppp} but using these would require re-calculating
#' \code{G}, \code{g}, \code{e}, and \code{ef} in the \code{kaya_data}
#' data frame.
#'
#' The package uses data on energy consumption and fossil-fuel CO2 emissions
#' from the
#' \href{https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html}{2018 BP Statistical Review of World Energy}

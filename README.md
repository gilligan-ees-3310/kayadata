kayadata
========

This package loads Kaya-identity data, synthesized from several sources.

To install and load the package, first install either the `pacman` or `devtools` package from CRAN:
```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("gilligan-ees-3310/kayadata")
library(kayadata)
```
or
```
install.packages("pacman")
p_load_gh("gilligan-ees-3310/kayadata")
```

Once you've installed it, then you just need to use the command `library(kayadata)` to load the package.

Some of the functions the package provides are:

* `country_list()`: Get a list of available countries.
* `get_kaya_data()`: Get data for a specific country. Example: `finland_data = get_kaya_data("Finland")`
* `project_top_down()`: Project future population, GDP, energy use, and emissions. Example: `finland_2050 = project_top_down("Finland", 2050)`
* `get_fuel_mix`: Get the fuel mix (coal, gas, oil, nuclear, and renewables) for a country. Example: `finland_mix = get_fuel_mix("Finland")`

From RStudio, you can get more help by typing `help(package="kayadata")` in the R console window.
